# Partnership Inquiry Automation – No-Code AI Workflow

### Built by: Sameer Pathania

This project automates the initial screening of partnership inquiry emails received by Samarth Eldercare. 
The system uses **Zapier + Email Parser + AI (ChatGPT)** to extract information and automate responses.
